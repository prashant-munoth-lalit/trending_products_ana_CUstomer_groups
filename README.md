Description
Small businesses currently do not have the means for personalized recommendations. This project will be the first step to alleviate this problem. Uisng point of sale data, google analytics data and from other data sources models will be developed to identify trending products, segment customers, and what products to market to those customer segments. The project will be able to identify the top trending products over a time frame, which products are most likely to be purchased by a given customer group, identify the impact of brand loyalty, and segment products into two groups that can be marketed to segments:1)top recurring items ie accessories that are commonly repurchased and 2) high value items.
